<p>Hello my name is Ethan Irvine. I recently found out about what coding was and after about an hour of trying it I fell in love. 
I am a huge sports fan of the major US Sports and while I do have my favorite teams I just like to watch the games for the competition between the two teams.
I also have a nerdy side, almost every Friday night you will find me play Magic the Gathering at Fallen Phoenix Games and I try to make it out to
Magic Fest Phoenix every year for at least a day. </p>
